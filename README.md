# Interactive Insights: Visual Thinking in Plasma Astrophysics

Welcome to the repository for **Interactive Insights** — a collection of web apps designed to explore the fascinating world of plasma astrophysics. These interactive tools bridge the gap between theory, intuition, and observation, offering a hands-on way to visualize complex astrophysical phenomena.

## Purpose  
This repository hosts a variety of interactive applications aimed at making plasma physics, high-energy astrophysics, and related fields more accessible and engaging. The tools allow users to explore key concepts such as magnetic fields, plasma dynamics, and high-energy phenomena through visualizations that invite curiosity and deeper understanding.

## Features
- **Interactive Simulations:** Visualize and experiment with plasma physics concepts, from magnetic reconnection to shock waves and instabilities.
- **Dynamic Visualizations:** Explore complex phenomena like fields, flares, and waves as they evolve in real time.
- **Educational Tools:** Designed to support both learners and researchers, these tools help build a stronger intuitive understanding of the universe’s high-energy processes.
