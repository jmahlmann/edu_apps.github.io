# Interactive Insights: Visual Thinking in Plasma Astrophysics

Welcome to the repository for **Interactive Insights** â€” a collection of web apps designed to explore the world of plasma astrophysics. These interactive tools bridge theory, intuition, observation, and experiment with hands-on experiences to visualize complex astrophysical phenomena.

## Purpose  
This repository features interactive tools for exploring plasma physics, high-energy astrophysics, and related fields. They focus on visualizing key concepts like magnetic fields, plasma dynamics, and high-energy phenomena, making these ideas more tangible and fun to experiment with.


## View the Apps  
Explore the full collection of apps on the [Interactive Insights website](https://jmahlmann.github.io/edu_apps.github.io/).

## Feedback and Ideas  
For feedback, suggestions, or ideas on existing and future apps, please reach out to [Jens Mahlmann](https://jensmahlmann.com/) at [jens.f.mahlmann@dartmouth.edu](mailto:jens.f.mahlmann@dartmouth.edu).

## Acknowledgments  
- Built with the support of **generative AI tools** in the development pipeline.  
- Created in collaboration with **ASTR 75** participants at **Dartmouth College**, whose ideas and enthusiasm helped shape these tools.  
- A big thank you to **everybody** who helps make these resources freely available for the broader scientific community.
